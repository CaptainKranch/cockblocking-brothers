Jennifer Ann Gries, a 25-year-old housing-services supervisor at California’s Stanford University, appears to lack the critical-thinking skills and good judgement demanded by her job description. For some reason, she was surprised when her claims of being forcibly raped on-campus drew a lot of attention.

Inept as she was, she nevertheless managed to create a climate of fear among the students that exacerbated their hostility to campus administrators, while the university paid out over $300,000 in investigation and security costs. Stanford activists, meanwhile, used the rape scare—both when Gries’s claims were believed to be genuine, and even when they were proven to be false—to advance their own agendas. Their actions reveal a great deal about the state of sexual politics at one of the United States’ most prestigious universities.
